    <h1>My Movie-Api Documentation</h1>
    <h2>The 5 W´s</h2>
    <p>Who—Your immediate users will be frontend developers 
        who’ll work on the client-side for the application based on what’s been 
        documented on the server-side (in this case, this developer is also you!). 
        You should also consider the users of the myFlix application. These will 
        be movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading information 
        about different movies.</p><br>
    <p>What—The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, 
        business logic, and business layers of the application. It will consist of a 
        well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js,
         Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods 
         like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database 
         #and store that data in a non-relational way.</p><br>
