    <h1>My Movie-Api Documentation</h1>
    <h2>The 5 W´s</h2>
    <p>Who—Your immediate users will be frontend developers 
        who’ll work on the client-side for the application based on what’s been 
        documented on the server-side (in this case, this developer is also you!). 
        You should also consider the users of the myFlix application. These will 
        be movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading information 
        about different movies.</p><br>
    <p>What—The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, 
        business logic, and business layers of the application. It will consist of a 
        well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js,
         Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods 
         like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database 
         #and store that data in a non-relational way.</p><br>

         <h4>why use Angular  for question 1? </h4>
         <p>It’s amazingly fast, even for big applications.
            It’s well suited to complex UIs, particularly animations. Because it has pultiple vies and you´ll probably animate some statistics. Its well suited for that. 
            It's made, used, and supported by Google so, once again, you can rest assured that an entire team is working to keep the framework well documented, up to date, and as bug free as possible.
            </p>

         <h4>why use React for Question 2?</h4>
         <p>React has its virtual DOM, which ensures faster rendering of views. This makes React appropriate for heavy-loaded and dynamic software solutions
            Bcause the App is so heavy loaded its suits the best.
            React is supported by a wide community of engineers and developers, especially from Facebook. This makes it stable and that is important for heavy loadsd of data</p>

         <h4>Why use Vue.js for Question3?</h4>
         <p>It’s progressive. Even if you already have a fully-coded application, you can progressively adapt it to include some native-like functionality.
            It has a small footprint (~20KB minified, compared to 42KB for React, and 111K for Angular).
            So its easier to start and build an app. And you can add other Frameworks as soon as the app will grow</p>

            <h3>Why React suits well for FAbiFlix</h3>
            <p>It can handle big data very well. So as the app possibly grows react will be able to ahndle that
            It is also a bit easier to learn at first compared to angular</p>
